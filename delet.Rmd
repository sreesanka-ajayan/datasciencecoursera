This is an R Markdown document. 
Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. 



Settings
----
We are going to plot 'Mileage per gallon' vs 'Weight (1000 lbs)', by '# of cylinders'
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(plotly)
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(plotly)
```

Settings (cont.)
----
```{r, echo=TRUE}
f <- list(
  family = "Courier New, monospace",
  size = 11,   color = "#6e6e6e" )
x <- list(
  title = "Weight (1000 lbs)",   titlefont = f )
y <- list(
  title = "Mileage per gallon",   titlefont = f )
```

```{r , eval=FALSE}
plot_ly(mtcars, x = mtcars$wt, y=mtcars$mpg, mode="markers", 
        type="scatter",color=as.factor(mtcars$cyl), size=mtcars$hp ) %>%   
        layout(xaxis=x, yaxis=y)
```


Plotting
----
```{r , echo=FALSE}
plot_ly(mtcars, x = mtcars$wt, y=mtcars$mpg, mode="markers",showlegend=TRUE, 
        type="scatter",color=as.factor(mtcars$cyl), size=mtcars$hp ) %>%   
        layout(xaxis=x, yaxis=y)
```

Interpretation
----
Simply put: 

- At a glance, what it can be grasped from this analysis is that the less is the weight and number of cylinders in a motor, the more is the mileage per gallon, and conversely, the more the weight, less is the mileage per gallon.
